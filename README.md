## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine (v16 or higher is recommended).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-meeting-minutes-generator.git
    cd ai-meeting-minutes-generator
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    (Note: This project uses CDN imports for React, so no `npm install` is needed for core libraries. If you add other dependencies, you would run `npm install` here.)

3.  **Run the application:**
    You can serve the `index.html` file using a simple local server. A common tool for this is `live-server`.
    ```bash
    # If you don't have live-server, install it globally:
    npm install -g live-server

    # Run the server from the project root
    live-server
    ```
    The application will open automatically in your default browser.
